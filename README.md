# Description
Heart related diseases are the main reason for a huge number of death in the world over the last few decades and has emerged as the most 
life-threatening disease, not only in India but in the whole world. So, there is a need of reliable, accurate and feasible system to diagnose 
such diseases in time for proper treatment. Machine Learning algorithms and techniques have been applied to various medical d atasets to 
automate the analysis of large and complex data. Many researchers, in recent times, havebeen using several machine learning techniques 
to help the health care industry and the professionals in the diagnosis of heart related diseases. This paper presents a survey of various 
models based on such algorithms and techniques and analyze their performance. Models based on supervised learning algorithms such as 
Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF) and ensemble models are found 
very popular among the researchers.
