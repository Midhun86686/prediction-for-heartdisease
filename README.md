# Description
Heart related diseases are the main reason for a huge number of death in the world over the last few decades and has emerged as the most 
life-threatening disease, not only in India but in the whole world. So, there is a need of reliable, accurate and feasible system to diagnose 
such diseases in time for proper treatment. Machine Learning algorithms and techniques have been applied to various medical d atasets to 
automate the analysis of large and complex data. Many researchers, in recent times, havebeen using several machine learning techniques 
to help the health care industry and the professionals in the diagnosis of heart related diseases. This paper presents a survey of various 
models based on such algorithms and techniques and analyze their performance. Models based on supervised learning algorithms such as 
Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF) and ensemble models are found 
very popular among the researchers.

# Introduction
Heart is an important organ of the human body. It pumps blood to 
every part of our anatomy. If it fails to function correctly, then the 
brain and various other organs will stop working, and within few 
minutes, the person will die. Change in lifestyle, work related stress 
and bad food habits contribute to the increase in rate of several heart 
related diseases.
Medical organisations, all around the world, collect data on various 
health related issues. These data can be exploited using various 
machine learning techniques to gain useful insights. But the data 
collected is very massive and, many a times, this data can be very 
noisy. These datasets, which are too overwhelming for human minds 
to  comprehend,  can  be  easily  explored  using  various  machine 
learning techniques. Thus, these algorithms have become very useful.
# Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality  Reduction  involves  selecting  a  mathematical 
representation such that one can relate the majority of, but not all, 
the variance within the given data, thereby including only most 
significant  information.  The  data  considered  for  a  task  or  a 
problem, may consists of a lot of attributesor dimensions, but not 
all of these attributes may equally influence the output. A large 
number of attributes, or features, may affect the computational 
complexity and may even lead to overfitting which leads to poor 
results.
# Conclusion
Based on the above review, it can be concluded that there is ahuge 
scope for machine learning algorithms in predicting cardiovascular 
diseases  or  heart  related diseases.  Each  of the  above-mentioned 
algorithms have performed extremely well in some cases but poorly 
in some other cases. Alternating decision trees when used with PCA, 
have performed extremely well but decision trees have performed 
very poorly in some other cases which could be due to overfitting. 
Random Forest and Ensemble models have performed very well 
because they solve the problem of overfitting by employing multiple 
algorithms (multiple Decision Trees in case of Random Forest). 
Models based on Na√Øve Bayes classifier were computationally very 
fast and have alsoperformed well.SVM performed extremely well for 
most of the cases. Systems based on machine learning algorithms 
andtechniques have been very accurate in predicting the heart related
